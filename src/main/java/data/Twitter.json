To limit other things that we are doing in the arena of web3gaming.\n\nI don锟絫 know what it is, but I need your help. The days we started to become trending on Opensea this happened.\n\nAnd before that our verification buttons were always unclickable, and even tho we reached out many times to them, they never wanted to help resolve that either.\n\nReally need everyone锟絪 support, shares, and anything else you can do to help our voice heard, and not get such an unfair treatment which will limit the potential of our growth if nothing is done.\n\nThere is so many people who are holding assets of Seedworld, and this is a very unfair treatment to all of them too.\n\nThank you. \n\nWe锟絭e been building Seedworld to grow web3gaming.
